# PAK-Manipulator
 
 GUI for manipulating PAK files for the Neversoft Guitar Hero Games.

## Usage

### Extracting

To extract a PAK file, simply drag and drop it onto the text box in the PAK Extract tab and click Extract. The program will create a folder with the same name as the PAK file and extract all the files into it.

### Rebuilding

Rebuilding a PAK file cannot be done as a batch operation. The program will only rebuild one PAK file at a time. 

To rebuild a PAK file, drag and drop the folder containing the extracted PAK files onto the text box in the PAK Compile tab and click Compile. The program will create a PAK file with the same name as the folder and place it in the same directory as the folder. Selecting a different console with the radio buttons will change the extension the PAK file is saved as.
